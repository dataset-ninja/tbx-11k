The dataset consists of 11702 images with 1211 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *ActiveTuberculosis* and *ObsoletePulmonaryTuberculosis*.

Images in the TBX11K dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 10903 (93% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (6600 images), *test* (3302 images), and *val* (1800 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 6 categories: ***healthy*** (3800 images), ***sick_but_non-tb*** (3800 images), ***active_tb*** (630 images), ***latent_tb*** (139 images), ***active&latent_tb*** (30 images), and ***uncertain_tb*** (0 objects).
